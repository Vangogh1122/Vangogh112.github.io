Hello, I’m vangogh! 
I am a common student at the Chinese University of Shi Jia Zhuang (TieDao), majoring in Software  Engineering. Currently, I am learning some knowledge about operating systems and data structures. At present, I plan to take the postgraduate entrance exam. If I fail to pass, I will consider brushing the algorithm questions and try to interview the company's algorithm post.
I started learning computer programming when I was a junior middle school student. I like programming! I am proficient with C++, Python and VB.  
The programming tool I use more often now is idea，pycharm，clion，I also know the basic use of matlab.
To learn more about me, you can have a view of my CV page here, or download my resume here: English version or Chinese version. 
I like writing blogs to summarize the knowledge or record my interesting experiments. I like sharing and discussing things with others. Visit my Chinese blog here!
